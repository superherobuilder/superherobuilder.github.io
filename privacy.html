        <li>We do not share any data with third parties for tracking purposes</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Non-Personalized Ads</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The ads you see are contextual and not based on your personal data</li>
        <li>Ads are shown based only on current app context and general location (country level)</li>
        <li>No personal information is collected or stored</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üõ°Ô∏è Children's Privacy</h2>
